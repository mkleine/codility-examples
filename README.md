Interesting introduction of codility: http://arkofmind.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/doing-a-test-with-codility/

More more tips on how to approach codility challenges are given here: http://dev.tasubo.com/2012/09/tips-for-tasks-on-codility.html

I've developed the examples presented here on my own. However, there are more example solutions out there, e.g., see
 * https://gist.github.com/mourner/1574304
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14042447/counting-disk-intersections-using-treeset

The solutions contain built-in tests that produce debugging output. Note that codility's test harness will always call the solutions' default constructors hence suppressing any debugging output.

The tests are run as default maven goal.
